## Change and reason

Describe the user-visible result and why it's needed. Link a non-sensitive
issue if there is one. Explain any effects on data, auth, providers, or deployment.

## Verification

List the commands you actually ran and their results. Explain which checks you
couldn't run and why. Don't present checks from another commit as evidence for this patch.
See [Contributing](https://github.com/madrobotnet/irang/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the isolated database and exact toolchain.

| Check | Result or reason not run |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run typecheck` | |
| `bun run lint -- --max-warnings=0` | |
| Full `bun test` with an explicit disposable `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | |
| Production `docker build` | |
| `git diff --check` | |
| Affected behavior exercised with synthetic data | |

For UI changes, include reviewed desktop and mobile screenshots. For docs,
record the separate prose-polishing pass and any link or command checks.
Share a short sanitized failure summary, not complete logs or files.

## Checklist

- [ ] The patch is focused and behavior changes have appropriate regression coverage.
- [ ] API and Auth provider modes, AI-off use, consent, and credential isolation are preserved.
- [ ] Affected documentation and translations are updated and separately polished.
- [ ] I've reviewed the patch, description, and attachments for secrets and private data.
- [ ] Verification used disposable local fixtures, not a live provider login or paid AI request.
- [ ] Any incomplete checks, compatibility effects, and data-migration needs are stated above.
